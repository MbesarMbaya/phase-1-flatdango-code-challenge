FlatDango Movie Ticketing  App

Flatdango is a web application that allows users to purchase movie tickets from the Flatiron Movie Theater. The app fetches data from a local server running a JSON database server.

Usage

When the application loads, you will see the details of the first movie, including its poster, title, runtime, showtime, and available tickets. You can also see a menu of all the movies on the left side of the page. To buy a ticket, click on the "Buy Ticket" button. The number of available tickets will decrease on the frontend.
